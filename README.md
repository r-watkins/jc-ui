# Welcome to my JumpCloud UI Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was made to work with the JumpCloud local server on the [assignment Github page](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/jumpcloud-ui-assignment).

## Running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will include the necessary dependencies. Then you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Features

Project features include:

- A list of current users
- Adding a new user
- Updating an existing user
- Deleting a user
- Ability to navigate app with keyboard only for accessibility
- Responsive layout that will fit most screen sizes
- Basic UI testing

### Project Specifications

The app is built using the following tech stack:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) as a front-end "framework".
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) as a component library.
- [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) as a styling utility.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as a testing framework.
- [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) as a testing utility.

## Project Workflow

The app is a single-page app. I started out with a quick wireframe to plan layout and features I wanted to include.
